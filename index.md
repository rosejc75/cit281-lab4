## Welcome to Rose's Lab 4

In this lab I learned how to work with Fastify. I learned how to add a code module to my file to get it to run.

### Node.js
I learned how to initialize a folder as a Node.js project using the command  "npm init -y" in the terminal. This automatically creates a package.json file for you.

### Installing fastify
I learned how to install Fastify using the command npm "install fastify --save"

### Git Repo
I learned how to initilize a git repo using the command "git init".
